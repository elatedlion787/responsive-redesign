        <h2> Argren.Net: A Norwegian Website In Need of Redesign</h2>
        <div class="body-2">
            <p> For this assignment for CS1300: UI/UX, I was tasked with finding and rebuilding a poorly-designed web UI page. </p>
            <p> The website I have chosen to redesign is Argren.net, a Norwegian-based e-commerce website. Argren.net tries to emulate the look of a 'yellow-pages' type website, but struggles to do so in a cohesive way.
                </p> <p> The website's layout is clunky, confusing and lacks basic structure or consistency. The design of the website is so inconvenient and unstructured, that I honestly believed it was a satirical website. The random information that is scattered throughout the page is hilarious and makes the website wonky to navigate.</p>

            <p> For your curiosity (or to find the funny random items listed on the website), check out <a href="https://www.arngren.net/">Argren.Net!</a> </p>
        </div>

        <div class="break"> <br> <br> <h3 style="background-color: rgb(16, 220, 196); margin: 0 auto; font-size: 30px; color: black text-"> Part 1: Website Overview</h3> 
        
        <p> Arngren.Net is a Norwegian e-commerce site that sells an assortment of random goods, ranging from electric vehicles to other electric items. It is actually unclear to tell what the company sells, because they have chosen to use a white-page layout, in which listings are not sorted, repeated and have inconsistent sizing, captions and text. </p> <p>Furthermore, there seems to be very very random links across the page. For example, in one image, you can see a link for a request to produce a sci-fi movie, other requests to find partners for production, various electric vehicles and random logos and information cited throughout the page. When translating to English the page is even more difficult to navigate, because the inconsistent text makes the website characters difficult to read</p>

        <p> To best illustrate the difficulty of using this interface, I will share a few screenshots of the website. Even as I do this project, I am still confused as to what the purpose of this site is (due to other pages, which aren't the focus of this project) being equally confusing</p>

        <p> The main page I will be redesigning is the page depicted on Figure 1. However, for fun, I've decided to show Norwegian and English screenshots of the wacky website</p>
        

        <div class="screenshots">
            <h5 style="font-size: 25px"> Figure 1: The Main Website Layout (Original Norwegian)</h5>
            <img src="image1.png" alt="Main Website" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%; width: 80%; height: 100%;"> 
            <h5 style="font-weight: 300"> As seen, the layout is clunky and it is difficult to understand what the purpose of the website is.</h5>

            <h5 style="font-size: 25px"> Figure 2: The Main Website Layout Extended(Original Norwegian)</h5>
            <img src="image2.png" alt="Main Website" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%; width: 80%; height: 100%;"> 
            <h5 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center; margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;"> The entire website does not fit on the screen, meaning that scrolling sideways makes it difficult to navigate</h5>

            <h5 style="font-size: 25px"> Figure 3: The Main Website Layout Footer(Original Norwegian)</h5>
            <img src="image5.png" alt="Main Website" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%; width: 80%; height: 100%;"> 
            <h5 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center; margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;"> The footer on the page is extremely random, does not match the style and also includes randomly formatted pictures and a link to the exact same webpage.</h5>

            <h5 style="font-size: 25px"> Figure 4: The Main Website Layout (English)</h5>
            <img src="image3.png" alt="Main Website" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%; width: 80%; height: 100%;"> 
            <h5 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center; margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;"> This website does not scale well for translation, as the clunky format makes the translated words stand over each other and difficult to navigate. There are also non-function features (such as the search bar) and random logos/icons that are clickable, but have no indication of such unless you play around and click them </h5>


            <h5 style="font-size: 25px"> Figure 5: The Main Website Layout (English) Extended</h5>
            <img src="image4.png" alt="Main Website" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%; width: 80%; height: 100%;"> 
            <h5 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center; margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;"> Looking at the English, there are actually very random links on the page. For example, a link to purchase a director role in a Norwegian science fiction is embedded within a motorized vehicle section</h5>

            <h5 style="font-size: 25px"> Figure 6: The Main Website Layout Footer(English) </h5>
            <img src="image6.png" alt="Main Website" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%; width: 80%; height: 100%;"> 
            <h5 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center; margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;">  When reading the footer, it seems that there are now randomly sections for some items (ie: Electronics) along with a disclaimer about price (which no user can see unless they actively scroll all the way to the bottom of the screen</h5>


            <h5 style="font-size: 25px;"> Figure 7: Extra Page: Clicking on an item</h5>
            <img src="image7.png" alt="Main Website" style="margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%; width: 80%; height: 100%;"> 
            <h5 style="font-weight: 300; text-align: center; margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;"> When clicking on an image on one of the bikes, the page that loads is actually a jumbled mix of every possible bike, listed in a vertical order. The images the bike belongs to are not clear, as the images are repeated across the screen. As per the main page, the full page does not fit the screen, so to read the page is difficult</h5>

                <h2> Usability Issues:</h2>
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle; text-align: left; justify-content:center; align-items: center;;">
                    <li> <strong> Layout: </strong>The website does not have a consistent layout and structure in terms of how items are sized, formatted or displayed on the screen. There is no cohension between elements on the screen, and it seems like elements have been randomly splattered on the screen </li>
                    <li> <strong> No Product Organization: </strong> Products are not organized outside of the left-handed directory, which doesn't seem to correlate with all the items on the main page</li>
                    <li> <strong> No Marking of Sold Out Products: </strong> Because these products are all listings (there are no details on when the listings are closed), you are able to view products (sometimes listed by third-parties) that have been already sold </li>
                    <li> <strong> Browser Fit: </strong>The website is not scaled for different devices, meaning it is incredibly difficult to view on devices with less screen space</li>
                    <li> <strong> Text Formatting: </strong> It is unclear which text belongs to which images</li>
                    <li> <strong> Repetition:</strong> There actually multiple pictures repeated across the screen. It is only difficult to notice due to the sheer range of items</li>
                    <li> <strong> Protruding Photos: </strong> Some photos are protuding off the pages</li>
                    <li> <strong> Lack of Theme/Cohesion: </strong> While the page seems to be a e-commerce site for technology and gadgets, there are a variety of links (such as a wifi-speed testing link, picture tiles, links to Playboy items and links to Craiglist-like listings looking for actors and directors) for products that don't fit the theme. These are not present on the left hand screen</li>
                    <li> <strong> Broken Components: </strong>The Search Bar, which is placed on two inconvenient places on the screen, does not actually work, making it hard to parse through the listings</li>
                    <li> <strong> Poor Translation: </strong> Due to the inconsistency of text sizing, image sizing and the general website layout, the English version does not scale particularly well</li>

                    <li> <strong> Inconsistent Colors: </strong> There are way too many colors used on the website, without a clear reason</li>
                    <li> <strong> Unclear Buttons:</strong> The main about page for the website is the logo on the top-left. However, this is not clear along with a few other clickable icons hidden on the screen </li>
                    
                  </ul>

            <div class="id">
                <h2> Accessibility Issues:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li> <strong> Usability: </strong> The usability of the website is horrendous. Not only is it impossible to search and index for specific products, it is fairly difficult to determine what information is referring to what image/product. Without a working search bar and a formatted webpage, I have struggled to find the user flow to go from seeing a product to understanding how to purchase a product. Without such fludity, it is almost impossible to see this website as even reasonbly functionable</li>

                <li> <strong> Learnability: </strong> With no documentation or visible cohesion/format, it is impossible to learn how to use the interface. In the case new products are added, the user will have to completely re-learn the layout of the website, as its usability is dependent on knowing exactly where within the large screen (which doesn't fit in the browser), their item is. </li>

                <li> <strong> Memorability: </strong> The website is fairly memorable, but largely because of its awful UI. The main elements I believe that preserve the website's character are it's aspects of randomness and weird layouts.When redesigning this UI, I don't want to get rid of all the randomness and weird quirks of the website, but I'd like to make it a minimal feature, rather than a critical building block of the website design.</li>
                </ul>

                <li> <strong> Accessibility: </strong> The accessibility problems that WebAIM Wave brought up were: 
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none; text-align: center; list-style-position: inside">
                    <li> <em>Poor Contrast:</em> Due to the inconsistency of colors and contrast used, some items have poor contrast between the text and background colors. There are also no consideration for colorblind users.</li> 
                    <li> <em> Text Sizing:</em>Due to the lack of formatting with image and text sizing, some of the font-sizes used are too small for people with vision issues and will be difficult to navigate</li> 
                    <li> <em>No Alternative Text:</em> Many of the images have no alternative text, making it very difficult for users who rely on such a feature, to use</li> 
                    </ul>
